Adding colors to your text is supported by the [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/color <tt>color</tt>] package, which is further extended by the  [http://www.ctan.org/pkg/xcolor <tt>xcolor</tt>] package. 


==Package Options ==

To keep it simple, only package <code>xcolor</code> is addressed. Following are the most common options, which should be given as the optional argument when loading the documentclass.

<code>dvipsnames</code>, <code>svgnames</code> and <code>x11names</code> load a set of predefined colors. Have a look at the xcolor manual (section 4 Colors by names) to see a full list including examples of which colors are available.

Two other important options are <code>hyperref</code> (support in terms of color expressions by defining additional keys) and <code>table</code> (loading the <code>colortbl</code> package).

==Entering colored text==

<syntaxhighlight lang="latex">
\documentclass[x11names]{article}
\usepackage{tikz}
\newcommand{\keyword}[1]{\textcolor{red!60!black}{#1}}
\newenvironment{important}{\par\color{black!80!green}\itshape}{\par}
\begin{document}
A simple macro defined and no \keyword{keyword} can hide.

\begin{important}
	some text \blindtext

	more \blindtext
\end{important}

The text after the environment looks normal again.

\tikz \draw [fill=Firebrick2] (0,0) circle (1cm);

Try the example out yourself.
\end{document}
</syntaxhighlight>

Defining own macros and/or environments is not mandatory but help to keep the document consistent. You can use the color commands raw. <code>\textcolor</code> is well suited for single words or short passages of text. If you need multiple paragraps, better use <code>\color</code>.




== Boxes with a colored background ==

Better not do anything by hand. Packages like [http://ctan.org/pkg/tcolorbox tcolorbox] or [http://ctan.org/pkg/mdframed mdframed] can ease your work to achieve your goal. 

==Defining new colors==

If you are not satisfied with the predefined colors, you can define your own.

<syntaxhighlight lang="latex">
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{xcolor}
\definecolor{landanimal}{rgb}{.545,.1,.1}
\colorlet{ocean}{blue!60!black}
\newcommand{\earth}[1]{\textcolor{landanimal}{#1}}
\newcommand{\water}[1]{\textcolor{ocean}{#1}}
\begin{document}
Many different animals live in the zoo, the \earth{Wombat} is
not alone. Some have even spotted a \water{dolphin}.
\end{document}
</syntaxhighlight>

This can be done by mixing predefined colors or by defining the values by hand. Package <code>xcolor</code> supports different color schemes. A look into the manual will lead to fast results. 

===Creating/Capturing colors===

You may want to use colors that appear on another document, web pages, pictures, etc.
Alternatively, you may want to play around with rgb values to create your own custom colors.

Image processing suites like the free [http://www.gimp.org/downloads/ GIMP] suite for Linux/Windows/Mac offer color picker facilities to capture any color on your screen or synthesize colors directly from their respective rgb / hsv / hexadecimal values. 

Smaller, free utilities also exist:
* Linux/BSD: The [http://gcolor2.sourceforge.net/ gcolor2] tool (usually also available in repositories)
* Microsoft Windows: The open-source [http://colorselector.sourceforge.net/ Color Selector] tool.
* Apple Macs: [http://wafflesoftware.net/hexpicker/ Hex Color Picker] for creating custom colors and the built-in [http://www.apple.com/uk/osx/apps/all.html#colormeter DigitalColor Meter] for capturing colors on screen.
* Online utilities: See here for a [[w:Color_tool|Wikipedia article with several external links]]

=== Spot colors ===

Spot colors are customary in printing. They usually refer to pre-mixed inks based on a swatchbook (like Pantone, TruMatch or Toyo). The package {{LaTeX/Package|colorspace}} extends xcolor to provide real spot colors. They are defined with, say:

{{LaTeX/Usage|code=
\definespotcolor{mygreen}{PANTONE 7716 C}{.83, 0, .40, .11}
}}
